  "description": "A 3-to-8 decoder is a combinational logic circuit that receives a 3-bit input and generates 8 output signals. Each output signal corresponds to one of the 8 possible combinations of binary values for the 3 input bits.\n\nThe circuit has 3 input lines (A, B, and C) and 8 output lines (Y0 to Y7). Each output line is connected to a specific combination of input lines, such that only one output is active (high) for a given input combination. The mapping of input to output is as follows:\n\nWhen A=0, B=0, and C=0, Y0 is active (high).\nWhen A=0, B=0, and C=1, Y1 is active (high).\nWhen A=0, B=1, and C=0, Y2 is active (high).\nWhen A=0, B=1, and C=1, Y3 is active (high).\nWhen A=1, B=0, and C=0, Y4 is active (high).\nWhen A=1, B=0, and C=1, Y5 is active (high).\nWhen A=1, B=1, and C=0, Y6 is active (high).\nWhen A=1, B=1, and C=1, Y7 is active (high).\nThe circuit can be implemented using a combination of AND gates and NOT gates. Each output line is connected to the outputs of several AND gates, each of which has one input connected to a specific combination of the input lines. The other input of each AND gate is connected to an inverter (NOT gate), which produces the complement of the corresponding input bit."
