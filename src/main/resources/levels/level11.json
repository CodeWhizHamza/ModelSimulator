Each output signal corresponds to one of the 8 possible combinations of binary values for the 3 input bits.\n\nThe circuit has 3 input lines (A, B, and C) and 8 output lines (Y0 to Y7). Each output line is connected to a specific combination of input lines, such that only one output is active (high) for a given input combination. The mapping of input to output is as follows:\n\nWhen A\u003d0, B\u003d0, and C\u003d0, Y0 is active (high).\nWhen A\u003d0, B\u003d0, and C\u003d1, Y1 is active (high).\nWhen A\u003d0, B\u003d1, and C\u003d0, Y2 is active (high).\nWhen A\u003d0, B\u003d1, and C\u003d1, Y3 is active (high).\nWhen A\u003d1, B\u003d0, and C\u003d0, Y4 is active (high).\nWhen A\u003d1, B\u003d0, and C\u003d1, Y5 is active (high).\nWhen A\u003d1, B\u003d1, and C\u003d0, Y6 is active (high).\nWhen A\u003d1, B\u003d1, and C\u003d1, Y7 is active (high).\nThe circuit can be implemented using a combination of AND gates and NOT gates. Each output line is connected to the outputs of several AND gates, each of which has one input connected to a specific combination of the input lines. The other input of each AND gate is connected to an inverter (NOT gate), which produces the complement of the corresponding input bit."}
