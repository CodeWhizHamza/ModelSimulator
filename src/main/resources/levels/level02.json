Then, we apply these inverted signals as inputs to an AND gate. The output of the AND gate will be 1 only when both inputs are 0, which corresponds to the case where neither of the original input signals was present. Therefore, we invert the output of the AND gate using a NOT gate to obtain the final output of the OR gate.\n\nIn summary, an OR gate can be constructed with NOT and AND gates as follows:\n\n* Take the two input signals and invert them using NOT gates.\n* Apply the inverted signals as inputs to an AND gate.\n* Invert the output of the AND gate using a NOT gate to obtain the final output of the OR gate."}
