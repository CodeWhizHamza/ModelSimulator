  "description": "A half-adder is a digital circuit used to add two single-bit binary numbers (represented as A and B) together. It has two outputs: the sum (represented as S) and the carry (represented as C).\n\nThe half-adder circuit has two inputs (A and B) which are XOR-ed together to produce the sum output (S). The same two inputs (A and B) are also AND-ed together to produce the carry output (C).\nThe half-adder is a basic building block for more complex arithmetic circuits, such as full adders, which can add multi-bit binary numbers."
