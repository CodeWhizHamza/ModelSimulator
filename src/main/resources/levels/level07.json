The circuit consists of two half adders and an additional OR gate that combines the carry output of the two half adders.\n\nThe first half adder takes two binary inputs A and B and produces a sum output S and a carry output C1. The second half adder takes the sum output S and a carry input C2, which is the carry output from the previous half adder, and produces a final sum output and carry output.\n\nThe overall operation of the full adder is as follows: the input bits A and B are added along with the carry input C, and the sum output S and carry output C_out are produced. The sum output S is the binary sum of the three inputs, while the carry output C_out is the carry that is propagated to the next stage of the adder circuit.\n\nThe full adder is a fundamental building block of arithmetic circuits, and is used extensively in the design of microprocessors, digital signal processors, and other digital circuits."}
