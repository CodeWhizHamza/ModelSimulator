  "description": "A half subtractor is a combinational circuit that performs the subtraction of two bits, producing two outputs: a difference bit and a borrow bit. It has two inputs: minuend (X) and subtrahend (Y).\n\nThe circuit consists of an XOR gate and an AND gate. The XOR gate takes the inputs X and Y as its input and produces the difference bit (D). The AND gate takes X and the complement of Y (Y') as its input and produces the borrow bit (B).\n\nThe output difference bit (D) indicates the difference between X and Y, while the borrow bit (B) indicates whether or not a borrow is needed from the next higher order bit during subtraction."
