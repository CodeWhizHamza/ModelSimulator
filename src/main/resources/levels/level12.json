  "description": "A 4 to 16 decoder can be constructed from two 2 to 4 decoders. The input bits of the 4 to 16 decoder can be represented as two sets of 2 bits each, with the first set representing the most significant bits (MSBs) and the second set representing the least significant bits (LSBs).\n\nThe MSBs are fed as inputs to the first 2 to 4 decoder, which generates 4 outputs, each corresponding to one of the possible combinations of the MSB bits. These 4 outputs are then fed as select lines to the second 2 to 4 decoder. The LSBs are fed as inputs to both the first and second 2 to 4 decoders.\n\nThe second 2 to 4 decoder generates 4 outputs for each of the 4 select lines from the first decoder, resulting in a total of 16 outputs. Each output of the 4 to 16 decoder corresponds to a unique combination of the MSBs and LSBs.\n\nTherefore, the 4 to 16 decoder can be seen as a two-level hierarchical arrangement of decoders, with the first level decoding the MSBs and the second level decoding the LSBs."
